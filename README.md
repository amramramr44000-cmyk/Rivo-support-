# Rivo — Cloud Edition

Rivo is now a **GitHub Pages + Supabase** project.

GitHub Pages hosts the HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Supabase provides the shared backend:
- Supabase Auth: registration, login and persistent sessions
- PostgreSQL: profiles, settings, friends, friend requests, likes and view counters
- Supabase Storage: avatar, banner, mini image, music cover and music files

## Setup

### 1. Create a Supabase project
Create a project at https://supabase.com/.

### 2. Create the database
Open **SQL Editor** and run the entire `supabase_schema.sql` file.

### 3. Configure Auth
In **Authentication → Providers → Email**, turn **Confirm email** OFF for this version of Rivo.  
The UI uses username + password; internally each username gets a private synthetic auth email such as `username@users.rivo.app`.

### 4. Add your public keys
Open:

`js/supabase-config.js`

Replace:
- `url` with your Supabase Project URL
- `anonKey` with the Supabase **anon/public** key

Do **not** put a `service_role` or secret key in the browser.

### 5. Deploy to GitHub Pages
Push the project to GitHub and publish it with GitHub Pages.

No PHP/Python server is required. The browser talks directly to Supabase over HTTPS.

## Important migration note

The old build used IndexedDB, so data from the old local version is not automatically uploaded to Supabase.  
Accounts created after this cloud version is configured are stored centrally and can be used from other devices.

## Media

Rivo uploads selected images/audio to the `rivo-media` Storage bucket on profile save and then stores permanent URLs in PostgreSQL. This avoids keeping large base64 media blobs inside the profile row.

## Security

Supabase Auth handles passwords. Database Row Level Security limits direct profile-row access to the signed-in owner. Public profile/search/social actions are exposed through controlled PostgreSQL functions.

For a real production launch, add email verification, password reset and a custom server-side username/login flow instead of relying on synthetic auth email addresses.


## Performance + messaging

The newer build keeps the existing profile schema/data intact and adds: cached profile reads, batched friend/profile loading, debounced search, parallel media uploads, and a dedicated text-only messaging system.

After deploying the code, run the latest `supabase_schema.sql` once in Supabase SQL Editor. The migration only adds the `rivo_messages` table/functions and messaging preference data under each profile's existing `private_data`.


## Rivo v5 upgrade
This build adds PWA installation, light/dark mode, realtime notification center, browser notifications, five message reactions, emoji-only message styling, profile visitor tracking, and a protected admin dashboard.

### One-time Supabase admin bootstrap
After applying the full `supabase_schema.sql`, make your own account an admin once from the Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
insert into public.rivo_admin_users(user_id)
select id from public.profiles where username='YOUR_USERNAME';
```
The dashboard is at `pages/admin.html`. Never expose a service-role key in the website.


## Stories
Run `supabase_schema.sql` to enable one active Story per account for 12 hours, avatar story rings, story likes, unique viewer counts, owner deletion, and expiry cleanup. Story images are resized to 1080px and videos are reduced to a mobile-friendly 720p/24fps format in browsers that support MediaRecorder.

## Story storage cleanup fix

Supabase does not permit deleting `storage.objects` directly from PostgreSQL. Story deletion now removes the database row through RPC and removes the owner's media through the Supabase Storage API in the client. Expired stories are removed from the database by the cleanup RPC; a trusted server/Edge Function should be used for unattended physical cleanup of expired Storage objects.


## Rivo v10 security + authentication fix

This build fixes the signed-out login failure by removing the pre-authenticated `profiles` lookup. The username is normalized into the same synthetic Auth email used at registration, then Supabase Auth performs the actual credential check. The old session/profile cache is also cleared on logout so switching accounts cannot reuse stale profile data.

New account creation now uses a stronger password policy (10–128 characters with at least three character classes), a hidden honeypot, minimum interaction time, and a custom Rivo Human Check. The checkbox triggers a short SHA-256 proof-of-work plus interaction-signal checks before the Auth request is allowed. This adds friction to simple automation without introducing a third-party CAPTCHA dependency. For high-risk production deployments, also add server-side rate limiting / abuse monitoring because no browser-only control can be made impossible to automate.

### Rivo Human Check

No Cloudflare or other CAPTCHA setup is required. The browser presents a single familiar “I’m human” checkbox and runs the layered local checks already included in the project. Keep the Supabase Auth rate limits enabled in production.

## Rivo Social v1 additions

This build adds:

- `pages/posts.html`: social feed with post creation, up to 5 images per post, comments, 5 reaction types (`❤️ 😂 👍 😮 😢`) with one reaction per user, and reposts.
- Profile posts: each profile now shows its published posts and posts reposted by that profile.
- `pages/communities.html`: community discovery, community creation, public/friends/request-only join policies, owner approval/decline, member removal, and group chat.
- Realtime community messages through Supabase Realtime.
- All new writes are mediated by Supabase RPC functions and the new schema is included at the end of `supabase_schema.sql`.

### Supabase update
Run the complete `supabase_schema.sql` file in the Supabase SQL Editor for the project. Keep the existing `rivo-media` storage bucket and existing RLS/storage policies. No manual data migration is required for existing profiles, friends, messages, or stories.

## Calling privacy
Calls support Everyone / Friends only / Nobody under Settings → Calls. The call permission is enforced by Supabase RPC.


## Rivo Calls — cross-network reliability

The call client now supports TURN credentials and ICE restart. This is important when two users are on different networks/NATs: STUN can discover routes, while TURN provides a relay when direct ICE candidates cannot connect.

### Supabase Edge Function
Deploy `supabase/functions/rivo-turn/index.ts` as the `rivo-turn` function.

Set these server-side Supabase Function Secrets:
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
- `CLOUDFLARE_TURN_KEY_ID`
- `CLOUDFLARE_TURN_API_TOKEN`

Create a Cloudflare Realtime TURN key first. Do NOT place the Cloudflare API token in `js/supabase-config.js` or any browser code.

The browser is configured to call:
`https://stfjcrcualeggmiygqur.supabase.co/functions/v1/rivo-turn`

The client falls back to STUN if TURN credentials are unavailable, but reliable calls between restrictive/mobile networks require the TURN function to be deployed and configured.

## Rivo Calls — LiveKit Cloud

The call UI is preserved, but media transport now uses LiveKit Cloud instead of raw WebRTC/STUN/TURN. Supabase Realtime remains responsible for ringing, accept/decline, and hangup signaling. LiveKit's browser SDK handles audio/video transport, reconnection, adaptive streaming, and cross-network routing.

Deploy the bundled token function:

```bash
supabase functions deploy rivo-livekit-token
```

The exact function source is included at `supabase/functions/rivo-livekit-token/index.ts`, so you do not need to retype it in the Supabase Editor.

Set these Supabase Edge Function secrets (Dashboard → Edge Functions → Secrets):

- `LIVEKIT_URL` — your LiveKit Cloud WebSocket URL (`wss://...livekit.cloud`)
- `LIVEKIT_API_KEY` — LiveKit API key
- `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET` — LiveKit API secret

Never put the LiveKit API secret in `js/supabase-config.js` or any browser file. The Edge Function validates the user's Supabase session and mints a short-lived room token.

The frontend calls:
`https://stfjcrcualeggmiygqur.supabase.co/functions/v1/rivo-livekit-token`

The LiveKit client SDK is loaded from jsDelivr in the HTML pages. For production, pin and self-host the SDK if you want full control over dependency delivery.


## Calls v11 improvements
- LiveKit remains the media transport; the existing Rivo call UI is preserved.
- Audio capture uses WebRTC echo cancellation, noise suppression and auto gain control.
- LiveKit adaptive streaming + dynacast are enabled to reduce video bandwidth/CPU and adapt to network conditions.
- A connection-quality indicator is shown during calls.
- In-call audio output routing is exposed where the browser supports audio output selection; wired/Bluetooth devices are allowed to follow the phone/browser routing policy.
- A true in-app mini-call mode lets the user keep the call visible while interacting with the current Rivo page.
- Reconnection policy and initial connection retry settings were strengthened.


## Final cosmetic cleanup
- Removed the in-call minimize button and its mini-call behavior from the UI.
- Removed the in-call audio-output selector UI so the browser/device keeps its normal audio output behavior.
- No call signaling, LiveKit connection, token flow, media quality, or database logic was intentionally changed in this pass.


## Targeted Phase 2 additions (v21)
- Three-line mobile menu now shows **Sign out** for authenticated users; guests see **Sign in**.
- Added compact WhatsApp-style voice-message recording/sending to Messages. Voice files use the private `rivo-voice` Storage bucket.
- Added a small **Report** action on posts; each account can report a post once, and a post is removed automatically when it reaches 10 unique reports.
- Added an admin account editor for username/display name and **password reset**. Existing passwords are never readable/retrievable; the admin UI only lets an admin set a new password.
- New SQL migration: `supabase_phase3_voice_reports_admin.sql`. Run it once in Supabase SQL Editor.
- New Edge Function: `supabase/functions/rivo-admin-update-user/index.ts`. Deploy it as `rivo-admin-update-user` and keep the Supabase service-role key server-side.


## v23 surface fixes
- Call timer starts on successful initial LiveKit connection and stops on teardown.
- Mobile notifications portal the existing popover to document.body while open to avoid sticky-header/overflow stacking issues.
- Post images are clickable and open in a lightweight viewer with close/Escape support.


## v24 targeted fixes
- Post images remain frameless inside cards and open in a lightweight viewer.
- Camera attachment is refreshed when LiveKit publishes the local camera track and when camera is enabled.
- Mobile notification popover is fixed to the viewport above the mobile navigation area.

## Rivo notifications

Notifications are intentionally **in-app only**. Rivo listens to `public.rivo_notifications` through Supabase Realtime while the app is open, so there is no VAPID/Web Push setup, no browser permission prompt, and no extra Edge Function or webhook to configure.


## Rivo Economy
The package now includes `supabase_economy.sql`, which adds coins, the store, user inventory, transaction history, secure RPCs, starter items, and ad-reward throttling. Run the existing schema first, then run `supabase_economy.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor. The Settings page contains the coin balance + transfer modal, and Explore contains the Store.

The ad reward RPC intentionally enforces a 10–25 coin range, a short cooldown, and a daily cap. A production ad provider should call the reward RPC only after its own verified completion callback; the included button is the Rivo-side reward flow.


Economy v20: the storefront is intentionally removed from Explore. Cosmetic and profile-feature unlocks are presented directly inside the Profile Editor, with inline coin prices and purchase-on-click locks. Run supabase_economy.sql after the base schema so the Feature item type and catalog are available.

## Economy editor hardening (v22)
- Compact coin-only balance in the editor sidebar.
- Paid unlocks require an explicit confirmation modal before charging coins.
- Insufficient balance is reported only after the user confirms payment.
- Badge selection is independently gated per badge and cannot unlock sibling badges.
- Template selection no longer silently changes/opens a separately paid card style.
- Added a server-side `profiles.public_data` validation trigger in `supabase_economy.sql` to reject forged paid badges, frames, templates, card styles, and gated media/features when the required inventory item is not owned.


## v23 UI / reward video updates
- Mobile editor Save bar follows the mobile bottom navigation: it slides down when the nav hides and returns directly above it when the nav reappears. Preview is hidden on mobile to keep only Save.
- Coin reward videos are loaded from `videos/manifest.json`, selected randomly, and playback is capped at 30 seconds.
- Add MP4/WebM/OGG files to `videos/` and list their filenames in `videos/manifest.json`.

### Follow / friend update fix

- Fixed the economy ownership-validation trigger so follow/unfollow and friendship updates do not re-validate unrelated paid badges/cosmetics.
- Validation now targets `NEW.id`, which is correct for `SECURITY DEFINER` social RPCs that update another profile row.
- Added `supabase_social_economy_trigger_fix.sql
- `supabase_social_economy_guard_fix_v2.sql` (recommended final social/economy interoperability fix)` as a standalone migration for an already-running Supabase project.


## Final social/economy desktop fix

After applying `supabase_schema.sql` and `supabase_economy.sql`, run `supabase_desktop_social_economy_final_fix.sql` once in Supabase SQL Editor. This final migration replaces the friend-request RPCs with transaction-local trusted writes so the legacy profile guard cannot return a false `Access denied` for legitimate friend actions.

## Communities V2 — creation fee, moderation and voice rooms

The Communities V2 update keeps the existing community/chat APIs compatible while adding a server-side **10,000 coin creation fee**, community roles (`owner`, `moderator`, `member`), owner-controlled voice-start permissions (`everyone`, `moderators`, `owner`), and persistent LiveKit-backed community voice rooms.

Run `supabase_communities_v2.sql` after the current schema/economy setup (the same migration is also appended to the end of `supabase_schema.sql`). Deploy `supabase/functions/rivo-livekit-token/index.ts` so community room tokens are checked server-side against active membership.

The community list now opens a dedicated `pages/community.html` full-screen chat page. On phones the chat uses the full viewport with a members drawer; the old inline room remains only as a compatibility shell and is no longer used by the new list flow.

## Communities V3 voice polish
- Compact voice icon in the community header with live/connected state.
- Discord-style ringing prompt when a community voice room starts.
- In-chat mini voice panel showing participants, mute state, active speaker, join/leave events, and leave/mute controls.
- LiveKit audio playback handling and clearer connection/permission errors.
- Explicit owner/moderator/member permission presentation; server-side moderator/kick/voice eligibility remains enforced.

## Communities V4 update

The current ZIP includes the Communities V4 patch:
- Community capacity is enforced server-side at 50 members.
- Community voice rooms are capped server-side at 5 participants through LiveKit room configuration.
- Owner/moderator member actions are available from the member row: role management, voice mute/unmute, and removal.
- Voice mute state is persisted in Supabase and enforced again when a muted member tries to rejoin.
- Voice moderation is performed by the `rivo-livekit-token` Edge Function; LiveKit API secrets remain server-side.
- The community voice UI is compact on desktop and mobile, with a call/ringing icon in the community header, a join panel, per-person speaker mute and microphone status, and clear join/leave notifications.

Run `supabase_communities_v4_voice_moderation_limits.sql` after the previous community migrations. The same V4 SQL is appended to `supabase_schema.sql` for complete installs.

After deployment, redeploy the Edge Function:

`supabase functions deploy rivo-livekit-token`

The function requires the existing `LIVEKIT_URL`, `LIVEKIT_API_KEY`, and `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET` secrets.


## Communities V5 voice reliability
- Added automatic empty-room cleanup after the LiveKit room reaches zero participants.
- Fixed moderator unmute so published audio tracks are actually unmuted.
- Added an in-call compact community chat composer.
- Improved remote audio subscription/attachment and local microphone controls.
- Run `supabase_communities_v5_voice_reliability.sql` after the V4 community migration.
- Redeploy `supabase/functions/rivo-livekit-token`.


## Communities Voice V6
Run `supabase_communities_v6_mobile_voice_security.sql` after the Communities V5 migration (or use the updated complete `supabase_schema.sql`). It hardens join-request/member visibility, makes empty-room cleanup server-only, and supports the mobile Voice audio unlock flow in the frontend.
